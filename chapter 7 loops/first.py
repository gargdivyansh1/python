## if we talk about loops then it is same as c but the change is in their syntax

## while loop

i = 0 
while(i<=100):
    print(i)
    i+=1


## for loop 

## remember while using the range it does not take the last value 
for i in range(101):
    print(i)

a = "shreee"

for i in a:
    print(i)



## there are basically three keywords which we can use

## break -- when we want to terminate the loop
## continue -- when we want to skip the further steps
## pass -- when we want to skip this for later -- like abhi mn nhi hai baad mai kabhi iska code likh dunga .. abhi ke lie bhaad mai ja .. nhi likh rha
